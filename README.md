# VIRTUAL CALCULATOR

## Welcome to My Repository

The virtual calculator is a common calculator in python script, to exercise the already mentioned language.

It's organizaed into modules with their specific functions, so feel free to use any module that suits you or you need in any of your projects.

This is my first project in english. Still containing many written or logical errors, wich will be improved during my language improvement. But you can find other repositories of mine, in portugese wich is my native language
